# Situated Interactive MultiModal Conversations (SIMMC) Challenge 2020

Welcome to the Situated Interactive Multimodal Conversations (SIMMC) Track for [DSTC9][dstc9] 2020.

The SIMMC challenge aims to lay the foundations for the real-world assistant agents that can handle multimodal inputs, and perform multimodal actions.
We thus focus on **task-oriented** dialogs that encompass a **situated** multimodal user context in the form of a co-observed image or virtual reality (VR) environment.
The context is **dynamically** updated on each turn based on the user input and the assistant action.
Our challenge focuses on our SIMMC datasets, both of which are shopping domains:
(a) furniture (grounded in a shared virtual environment) and, 
(b) fashion (grounded in an evolving set of images).   

**Organizers**: Ahmad Beirami, Eunjoon Cho, Paul A. Crook, Ankita De, Alborz Geramifard, Satwik Kottur, Seungwhan Moon, Shivani Poddar, Rajen Subba

## Track Description

### Tasks and Metrics

We present three sub-tasks primarily aimed at replicating human-assistant actions in order to enable rich and interactive shopping scenarios.

| Sub-Task #1 | [Multimodal Action Prediction](mm_action_prediction) |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Goal | To predict the correct Assistant API action(s) (classification) |
| Input | Current user utterance, Dialog context, Multimodal context |
| Output |  Structural API (action & arguments) |
| Metrics |  Action Accuracy, Attribute Accuracy, Action Perplexity |

| Sub-Task #2 | [Multimodal Dialog Response Generation & Retrieval](mm_response_generation)  |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Goal | To generate Assistant responses or retrieve from a candidate pool  |
| Input | Current user utterance, Dialog context, Multimodal context, (Ground-truth API Calls) |
| Output | Assistant response utterance |
| Metrics | Generation: BLEU-4, Retrieval: MRR, R@1, R@5, R@10, Mean Rank |

| Sub-Task #3 | [Multimodal Dialog State Tracking (MM-DST)](mm_dst) |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Goal | To track user belief states across multiple turns |
| Input | Current user utterance, Dialogue context, Multimodal context |
| Output | Belief state for current user utterance |
| Metrics | Slot F1, Intent F1 |

for each subtask.

### Evaluation

For the DSTC9 SIMMC Track, we will do a two phase evaluation as follows. 

**Challenge Period 1**:
Participants will evaluate the model performance on the provided `devtest` set.
At the end of Challenge Period 1 (Sept 28), we ask participants to submit their model prediction results and a link to their code repository.

**Challenge Period 2**:
A `test-std` set will be released on Sept 28 for the participants who submitted the results for the Challenge Period 1.
We ask participants to submit their model predictions on the `test-std` set by Oct 5. 
We will announce the final results and the winners on Oct 12.


## Challenge Instructions

### (1) Challenge Registration

* Fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/jdT79eBeySHVoa1QA) to register at DSTC9. Check “**Track 4: Visually Grounded Dialog Track**” along with other tracks you are participating in.

### (2) Download Datasets and Code

* Irrespective of participation in the challenge, we'd like to encourge those interested in this dataset to complete this [optional survey](https://oculus.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1AlazoSV7iwepZH). This will also help us communicate any future updates on the codebase, the datasets, and the challenge track.

* Git clone our repository to download the datasets and the code. You may use the provided baselines as a starting point to develop your models.
```
$ git lfs install
$ git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/simmc.git
```

### (3) Reporting Results for Challenge Phase 1
* Submit your model prediction results on the `devtest` set, following the [submission instructions](./SUBMISSION_INSTRUCTIONS.md). 
* We will release the `test-std` set (with ground-truth labels hidden) on Sept 28.

### (4) Reporting Results for Challenge Phase 2
* Submit your model prediction results on the `test-std` set, following the [submission instructions](./SUBMISSION_INSTRUCTIONS.md). 
* We will evaluate the participants’ model predictions using the same evaluation script for Phase 1, and announce the results.

**NOTE**: The [paper][simmc_arxiv] above describes in detail the datasets, the NLU/NLG/Coref annotations, and some of the baselines we provide in this challenge. The paper reports the results from an earlier version of the dataset and with different train-dev-test splits, hence the baseline performances on the challenge resources will be slightly different.
