**Allowed Inputs**

* The guideline below shows the input fields that are allowed (default) and disallowed (marked as 'X') at **inference time**, for each subtask.
* Participants are free to use any of the fields below during **training** though as additional supervision signals, and *e.g.* at the inference time use the reconstructed / predicted values instead.

**Notes**

`transcript_annotated` provides the detailed structural intents, slots and values for each USER turn, including the text spans. `system_transcript_annotated` provides the similar information for ASSISTANT turns.

`turn_label` expands `transcript_annotated` with the coreference labels annotated as well. `objects` field in `turn_label` includes a list of objects referred to in each turn - each marked with a local index throughout the dialog (`obj_idx`) and `obj_type`. `system_turn_label` provides the similar information for ASSISTANT turns.

`belief_state` provides the intents, slots, and values, where their slots and values are cumulative throughout the dialog whenever applicable. Each slot name is prepended with its domain name, e.g. `{domain}-{slot_name}`. Specifically, we include an object slot called `{domain}-O` whose values are `OBJECT_{local_idx}`. For instance, a `belief_state` with `act: DA:REQUEST:ADD_TO_CART:CLOTHING` with a slot `[[‘fashion-O’, ‘OBJECT_2’], [‘fashion-O’, ‘OBJECT_3’]]` would annotate a user belief state with the intention of adding objects 2 and 3 to the cart. 

The entire catalog information is stored in either `fashion_metadata.json` or `furniture_metadata.csv`. The API calls provide the state of the carousel (`furniture`) or focus item (`fashion`) after the ground truth API / actions have been called. By using these two, one should be able to retrieve the entire information about the catalog items that are potentially described in the system response.
